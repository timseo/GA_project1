#**SLOPPY DICE** 
___

_BECAUSE ITS GONNA GET SLOPPY_


####This is a Super Fun dice game!     


Any number of players may play this game but for this project and in consideration for pace of play we will be limiting it to 2 players.  

All you need are dice and a plastic cup and your choice in spirits.  

Fill a cup with your choice spirit and place in between players. 

Each player takes turns shooting 2 dice.  Should they roll a 7, 11 or Doubles. The other player drinks. The drinking player must consume the contents of the cup before the Winning shooter rolls 7, 11 or Doubles.  If the task cannot be achieved he must start over until successful.  Shooters who do not shoot 7, 11 or Doubles simply lose their turn and shooter to the left shoots.

I surmise that play would continue until someone drops to the floor but once again in consideration for pace of play. First player to 5 wins SLOPPY DICE!

Please feel free to use IRL cup of spirits in place of virtual glass.
